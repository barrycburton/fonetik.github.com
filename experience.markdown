We have more than 8 years of mobile software development experience. We were in the very first group of developers who were admitted to the iPhone SDK beta program in March of 2008, so we have been developing on that particular platform as long as anyone outside of Apple. As a result, we have a deep knowledge of the technology framework and can better apply the current technology to meet your particular needs, but also more accurately prepare to take advantage of future improvements.

Our previous mobile handset development experience was using the C based Brew platform for CDMA phones and the Java based J2ME platform for GSM phones. We worked with other groups to ship a number downloadable applications for Verizon's Get It Now application store. In addition we helped to develop the OEM applications natively installed on a number of Motorola and Samsung handsets on the Sprint and Verizon networks, including the messaging (MMS and SMS) client application used on the original Verizon Motorola RAZR.

We also have previously developed for PDAs, including writing a full featured notepad application for the Qtopia / Qt / Linux based Sharp Zaurus PDA. On the Zaurus, we also developed a handwriting recognition input method, a project that required designing new discrete algorithms for online, vector based character mapping. Other non-mobile development we have done has included working on highly scalable virtual routing algorithms for AT&T's internet backbone.

We also have years of experience developing and publishing on the web. We understand the many open protocols and standards that have made the web what it is. We also understand the practical considerations needed to make a site work and work well.

We have been building web applications, or 'active' web sites of one kind or another for just over eight years as well. Starting off with a brief period using MIVA Script before switching to PHP based web scripting. PHP was quite useful for interspersing various 'active' content in the static pages of a traditional web site, but PHP's inefficient syntax and deployment model made it awkward for building web apps.

Later we discovered the language Ruby and the web application platform Rails that transformed the way we thought about web applications. Suddenly, a web application could be built like a serious application, which meant faster development time and higher production quality. Ruby and Rails both offer very concise, readable syntax from which many of the productivity gains are realized. However, the structured development and deployment paradigms are what really enables such rapid and high quality products.

Our most recently finished project was designing a full technology infrastructure for a small business from the ground up. In addition to their physical information systems, we built up a web site with a storefront and blog, integrating their site with social media in a way to enable the best user experience for their customers.
